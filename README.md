AI-Driven-Crop-Disease-Detection-and-Adaptive-Treatment-System

This project focuses on developing an AI-based model to accurately detect and classify crop diseases using image data. By leveraging transfer learning and deep neural networks, the model aids farmers and agricultural professionals in early identification of plant diseases, leading to timely interventions and improved crop yield.

Project Overview
The goal is to create a robust and efficient machine learning model capable of:

Analyzing plant leaf images

Detecting the presence and type of disease

Assisting in real-time agricultural decision-making

Model Architecture
The model is built using MobileNetV2, a lightweight deep convolutional neural network optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications. The architecture is fine-tuned with:

Data Augmentation

Batch Normalization

Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

Dataset
The dataset contains thousands of labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves across various crop types. The images are preprocessed using:

Resizing and normalization

Image augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip)

Model Training Summary
Initial Training Phase (10 Epochs)
Metric	Result
Best Validation Accuracy	95.15% (Epoch 9)
Best Validation Loss	0.1465
